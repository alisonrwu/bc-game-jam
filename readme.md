The original game was made at BC Game Jam 2017. I (Trevin Wong) later took the game and refined it, adding the above features.

### Key Takeaways
- Composition is better than inheritance. I had a lot of subclasses that later became extremely messy. The next game I make I'd like to experiment with the ECS (Entity-Component-System) model, which is more centralized around composition.
- Make resolution-independent code whenever possible.
- Function calls are expensive in Lua.
- Global variables are expensive in Lua.
- A good way to optimize some algorithms is to narrow down the space in which the algorithm has to operate (i.e some radius around an object).
